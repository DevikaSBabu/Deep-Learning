#  Time Series Forecasting with LSTM - Air Passengers Dataset

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to perform time series forecasting on the classic **Air Passengers dataset**, which contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

# Features

-  **Time Series Forecasting** using LSTM to predict future values.
-  **LSTM Neural Network** designed for sequential time-dependent data.
-  Uses the **Air Passengers Dataset**, a popular benchmark in forecasting.
-  **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling, sequence creation, and reshaping for LSTM input.
-  **Training Visualization**: Plot of training and validation loss curves.
-  **Model Evaluation** using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
-  **Forecasting Future Months** beyond the original dataset.
-  Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** for ease of experimentation and deployment.
